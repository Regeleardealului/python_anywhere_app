Project Description: Gold Price Predictor

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict gold prices and deploying it as a web application. Here are the steps I followed:

    1. Data Collection: I downloaded a CSV file containing historical gold prices.
    2. Model Building: I used Jupyter Notebook to build and train a machine learning model with this data.
    3. Web Framework Creation: Using Flask, I created a web framework to serve the model predictions.
    4. Cloud Deployment: Finally, I deployed the application to the cloud using Heroku.
